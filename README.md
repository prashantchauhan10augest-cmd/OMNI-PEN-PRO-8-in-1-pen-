Omni Pen Pro - 8-in-1 3D Visualization

An interactive, web-based 3D mechanical feasibility model of the OmniPen Pro, a premium 8-in-1 multifunction tactical writing instrument. This project visualizes the product's internal architecture, rotary selection mechanism, and "Tactical Black & Chrome" aesthetic using WebGL.

✨ Features

8-in-1 Tool System

This model packs 8 distinct functional modules into a single 13.5mm chassis:

🖊️ Quad-Ink: Blue, Black, Red, and Green standard D1 refills.

✏️ Mechanical Pencil: 0.5mm precision lead system.

🖍️ Highlighter: Micro-fiber fluorescent yellow nib.

🩹 Correction Tape: Integrated 2.5mm micro-cassette (whitener).

🧽 Eraser: Top-mounted twist-action eraser unit.

Interactive Controls

Rotate Dial: Simulates the 51.4° indexed rotation of the selector ring to align tools.

Click to Extend: Visualizes the axial cam logic that deploys the active module.

Twist Eraser: Demonstrates the screw-thread mechanism for the top eraser.

Engineering Views

X-Ray Mode: Toggles shell transparency to reveal the internal "7+1" drum architecture.

Exploded View: Separates the outer housing from the internal chassis for component inspection.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Three.js: For high-fidelity 3D rendering, PBR materials, and animation.

HTML5 / CSS3: For the dark-mode user interface and overlay controls.

JavaScript (ES6): For mechanical logic, state management, and interaction handling.
